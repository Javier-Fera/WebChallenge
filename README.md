## Web Challenge Project

### 24/8/20

Project Begins!

Planned Workflow:

1. Make a skeleton HTML for each page, mobile first.
2. JS Functions
3. CSS styling for mobile view first.
4. Responsive layout
5. Launch project in Heroku.

Today's Progress: 

Created skeleton HTML 
The result page will get a JSON from a fetch. If the fetch is successful it will arrange the values as shown in the mock up. If nothing is returned then a message will appear stating the search yielded no results.

Next up:

Passing a value from one page to the other as a variable to call the fetch.
Functionallity to the buttons.
A (very likely regex) function to avoid searching for queries that does not fit the text@text.com structure or empty values.

After that:
Begin with styling in mobile
Add responsiveness

Finally:
Study and launch on Heroku.

### 25/8/20

Plenty of progress:

Created a JS validation function to avoid invalid emails or empty values.
Found a way to make a label input by making input invisible and a div double as the input space.
Added all the css to the mobile version of the webpage. 
Added red letters to the error message of the label and border.
Button now has colors for hover and click.

Next up:

Responsiveness for Tablet and Desktop views (according to the mock up, they are pretty similar)

Finally:

Heroku investigation and deployment.
