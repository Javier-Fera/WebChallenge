## Web Challenge Project

###24/8/20

Project Begins!

Planned Workflow:

1. Make a skeleton HTML for each page, mobile first.
2. JS Functions
3. CSS styling for mobile view first.
4. Responsive layout
5. Launch project in Heroku.

Today's Progress: 

Created skeleton HTML 
The result page will get a JSON from a fetch. If the fetch is successful it will arrange the values as shown in the mock up. If nothing is returned then a message will appear stating the search yielded no results.

Next up:

Passing a value from one page to the other as a variable to call the fetch.
Functionallity to the buttons.
A (very likely regex) function to avoid searching for queries that does not fit the text@text.com structure or empty values.

After that:
Begin with styling in mobile
Add responsiveness

Finally:
Study and launch on Heroku.
